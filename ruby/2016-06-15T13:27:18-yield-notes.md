### Notes about "yield" aka passing behavior to methods
#### basic example

```ruby
def calculate
  calculation = yield
end

calculate { 2 + 2 }
# => 4
calculate { 3 * 4 }
# => 12
```
#### Syntax of Working with Blocks
```ruby
calculate { 5 * 7 }
# => 35

calculate do
  product = 5 * 7
  product + 1
end
# => 36
```

#### Passing blocks arguments
```ruby
def verify(expected)
  yield(expected)
end

verify(5) { |n| n == 2 + 3 }
# => true
verify(9) { |n| n == 2 + 3 }
# => false
```

#### blocks maintain the scope in which they are defined...weird but cool :)
```ruby
def calculate
  calculation = yield
end

number = 5
calculate { number + 2 }
# =>
