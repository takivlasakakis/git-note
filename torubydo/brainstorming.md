### ToRubyDo    
#### brainstorming
* copy todotxt specs
* add markdown support
* nested lists
* multiple lists
* git/github integration?

* with multiple lists I could create a calendar workflow like straight a student mixed with trello mixed with todotxt
* eventually maybe a better editor but it still always translates to text and markdown
