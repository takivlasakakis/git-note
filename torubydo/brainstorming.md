### ToRubyDo    
#### brainstorming
* copy todotxt specs
* add markdown support
* nested lists
* multiple lists
* git/github integration?

* with multiple lists I could create a calendar workflow like straight a student mixed with trello mixed with todotxt
* eventually maybe a better editor but it still always translates to text and markdown

* note that iTerm has timestamps I could use that with to figure out when the notes were added
* note found [a way](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37364722/how-do-i-add-inline-comments-in-github-flavored-markdown?noredirect=1#comment62243032_37364722) to include comments and then potentially metadata into notes
