### Project Ideas

#### ToDo List (ToRubyDo or SwitchApp)

* Todo list that flows forward and backward and behaves like a tree
  * And it keeps time while your on each node so you can get analytics on what your doing
  * SwitchApp - don't multi-task, single-task...quickly
  * Quick single-tasking

#### Calendar application to schedule pairing sessions
* Calendar/Day planner that is more like Straight-A-Student process
* the key is difference between in the morning when planning day (more visual) and using (less visual) **note** this is really an extension of the todo app.

#### Scripting/workflows sublime/alfred

* Get alfred to talk to sublime
  * what language: ruby, python, bash?
  * [access to projects](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-sublime-text/issues/4#issuecomment-218190258)

#### Git-Note
* use a git repo with markdown files for note taking, see creation-process.md

#### Bookmark chrome extension

* Booking mark extension for chrome that pushes/pulls bookmarks from a github repository, or even better does it locally because it seems like you can talk to the file system from the browser.
  * then I could script the repo to match the file structure of git-note
  * or even better the bookmarks just live inside of a file inside of the directory inside of git-note
  * I could write an alfred workflow to parses the bookmarks
  * 

#### iPhone App ideas

* markdown viewer/editor on github
* convert from decimal to 1/16 in
* interval timer
    * let the app talk to google sheets to keep track of metrics
* Cooking timer

#### Connect scale to internet
* track weight of things
* maybe connect arduino to scale

#### Write an apple script to respond imessage
* like away messages except specifically for Jenny.
