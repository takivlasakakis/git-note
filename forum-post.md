I see what you're saying now, it's not that `subl` prevents multiple windows from being opened, it's that it saves the current state of the project so all your open views don't get deleted. It makes sense why you added the FWIW now because it's a cool trick, but it doesn't get us closer to preventing multiple projects from opening ;) oh well.

How about since we're going on tangents do you think any of this is related to the question I asked over [in your repository](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-sublime-text/issues/3)

*note: I totally know they're not related it just seems like I'm hearing back from you sooner over here :)
