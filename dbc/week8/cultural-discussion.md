1. Recently my girlfriend and I had a lengthy discussion after we went together to a dinner with a bunch of her coworkers. While talking with some of her coworkers I said something like "I disagree with " so and so point and then continued the discussion. Afterwards she said she felt uncomfortable when I did that because in general she feels like it's off-putting to tell people you disagree with them, especially when you don't know them well.

2. The main source of our conflict was she believes that saying you disagree with someone while in conversation is off-putting and I believed it was just part of normal conversation.

3. I felt frustrated and a defensive because at the time it felt like she was asking me to change something really fundamental about the way I communicate/enjoy to communicate with people.

4. We kept talking about the issue. I ended up talking with some of my family members also to get their perspective. The conversation was ongoing for about a week.

5. In light of our discussion I would have handled the way I interacted at the dinner differently; however, the way we worked through it was really right on. It was awesome working through a clear cut disagreement together and keeping kind and respectful while working to figure it out.

6. I learned that there are people who really do feel uncomfortable if you tell them you disagree with them and there are conversational techniques that can be used, like probing with questions, to keep the discussion alive without verbally declaring you disagree with someone.
