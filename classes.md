### Outline
Modify your program so that it has a user interface (a user can interact with your program via the command line).

Your user should be allowed to create as many instances of your class as they like.

Prompt the user for each attribute, and don't forget to convert their input to the appropriate data type. Store these class instances in an array.

When the user indicates that they are finished creating instances, loop through the array and print out the attributes of each instance as a confirmation message of what was created.
